# clccr

<!-- badges: start -->

The clccr package provides a set of functions to compute the commodity
life cycle costing (or CLCC) indicator, a measure of resource use by a
product/process during its life cycle. The indicator can be thought as a
life cycle costing (LCC) indicator developed like it were and life cycle
assessment (LCA) indicator: costs are treated like characterization
factors, while the classification ad characterization phases are carried
out like a conventional Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). Unlike
conventional LCC - which takes into account all costs related to the
life cycle of a product - the proposed indicator only considers costs
related to natural resource use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of clccr like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("giuliomela/clccr")
```

## Examples

These are basic examples which show you how to use the `clccr` package
to compute the CLCC indicator.

``` r
library(clccr)

# computing the CLCC indicator for a set of 
```
